### Build-up
The project is based on some key files and folder and some boilerplate and dependencies. Firstly picture (mostly for pizzas) can be found in the root/public folder. Most of the code can be found in the root/src foldere. Here you can find the components folder consisting of components that make up most of the frontend-side of the project, with various typescript file with corresponding css files. The other folder in root/src is the root/src/app. Next routes http://{root domain} to the app folder. It uses page.tsx files to render the page. From app paths can be found using the folder of app. An example is the rendering of the calculator page uses root/src/app/calculator/page.tsx. There is an exemption is the root/src/app/api folder which include api for fetching data from the database.
